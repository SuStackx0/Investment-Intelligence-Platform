At close, the Sensex was down 465.75 points or 0.55% at 83,938.71, and the Nifty was down 155.75 points or 0.60% at 25,722.10. The launch reaffirms POWERGRID’s leadership in promoting technological innovation, standardization, and indigenization in India’s transmission network. As of June 2025, Reliance Jio has a 5G user base of 213 million, the company had announced in its earnings release for the first quarter of the financial year 2026 (Q1FY26). According to Aayog, Direct Selling’s true strength lies in its inclusive design — creating livelihoods, empowering women, and extending entrepreneurship to rural India. The report mentioned that the retail consumption across the organised formats is estimated at a value of Rs 8.8 trillion for FY 2025. The rollout of GST 2.0 and strong digital payment momentum helped in gathering steam for India’s private consumption. India’s REIT (real estate investment trust) market is projected to reach Rs 19.7 lakh crore by 2030 from Rs 10.4 lakh crore in 2025, driven by high occupancy, favourable taxation and broader sectoral inclusion, according to a report released on Friday. The overall download speed clocked by Jio was double that of the nearest competitor, Airtel. For the first half of FY 2025–26, BSNL recorded total revenues of Rs 11,134 crore, combining Rs 6,000 crore (Q1) and Rs 5,347 crore (Q2).

Reliance Industries' revenue from operations rose 5% to ₹2,48,660 crore from ₹2,36,217 crore. | Image: Shutterstock Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Industries, the country's most valuable company, on Friday, July 18, reported a net profit of ₹26,994 crore in the first quarter of the current financial year, marking an increase of 78% from ₹15,138 crore in the same period last year. The sharp jump in profit came on the back of a strong surge in other income in the first quarter. Reliance Industries' other income in the June quarter jumped 280% to ₹15,119 crore as against ₹3,983 in the year-ago period. Other income included a gain of ₹8,924 crore, being proceeds of profit from the sale of listed investments, Reliance Industries said in an exchange filing. The Ambani-backed company sold its stake in Asian Paints in multiple tranches last month. Reliance Industries' revenue from operations rose 5% to ₹2,48,660 crore from ₹2,36,217 crore. Operationally, Reliance Industries reported stable performance as its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), also known as operating profit, rose nearly 11% to ₹ 42,905 crore, and its operating profit margin expanded by 80 basis points to 17.25% as against 16.41% seen in the corresponding period last year. Reliance Industries telecom arm Jio Platforms reported a net profit of ₹7,110 crore in Q1, marking an upside of 25% from ₹5,698 crore in the same period last year. Revenue for Jio Platforms advanced 19% annually to ₹41,054 crore, and its EBITDA advanced 24% to ₹18,135 crore. Jio's average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric to gauge the profitability of a telecom company, came in at ₹208.8 per user per month, up 15% from ₹181.70 in the same period last year. Reliance Industries retail arm, Reliance Retail Ventures, delivered stable growth performance in the first quarter as its net profit rose 28% to ₹3,271 crore. Its revenue from operations advanced 11% to ₹84,171 crore, its EBITDA rose 13% to ₹6,381 crore, and its EBITDA margin improved by 20 basis points to 8.7%. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, Reliance Retail expanded its store network with 388 new store openings, taking the total store count to 19,592 with an area under operation of 77.6 million square feet. The registered customer base grew to 358 million, the company said. Analysts, according to news reports, are positive on RIL stock post-Q1 results declaration. However, they note that the retail segment's revenue was lesser than expected and that the company's quarterly profit beat estimates due to a one-time gain from the stake sale of Asian Paints. Besides, they said that they are still assessing the impact of new European sanctions on Russian oil. Analysts at Macquarie, according to news reports, said that in the June quarter, Reliance Jio's numbers were robust, but the retail segment lagged growth. They added that Q1 earnings beat estimates driven by one-off investment gains. They note that during the quarter, Jio was strong and retail was lukewarm, while the O2C segment is gradually recovering. The analysts added that the share price could see a near-term moderation after the Q1 FY26 results announcement. Morgan Stanley also notes that the company missed estimates in both retail revenue growth and fuel refining. The analysts added that the company's guidance was optimistic with a plan to double earnings by 2029. They note that the new energy business, telecom business, and the balance sheet were the bright spots. However, they added that they were still figuring out the impact of new European sanctionss on Russian oil. It must be",
