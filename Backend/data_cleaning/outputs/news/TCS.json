The region hasn’t been doing well for the company in past quarters either. After seeing double-digit growth in FY24, the company’s sequential revenue growth in the UK has been dropping Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) denied reports that it lost a $1 billion contract with Marks & Spencer (M&S) due to a cyberattack. The company called the report “misleading”, saying M&S chose to work with other partners well before the April 2025 cyber incident. TCS added that the report contained factual inaccuracies regarding the contract’s size and its ongoing work with M&S. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Monday dismissed reports claiming that the Indian IT giant lost a $1 billion contract from British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S). The reports had claimed that the loss was due to a cyberattack M&S faced earlier this year. The Tata group company called the report \"misleading\", claiming that the retailer decided to work with other partners \"much prior to the cyber incident in April 2025\", and that the two matters are \"clearly unrelated.\" \"The report published by The Telegraph is misleading, with factual inaccuracies including the size of the contract and the continuity of TCS’ work for Marks & Spencer (M&S),\" the firm said in an exchange filing on October 27. Although this contract was not cancelled due to the cyberattack incident, it did hurt TCS' overall business in the last quarter. Before we get into that, let’s try to understand what happened with M&S. In late April this year, stores of Marks & Spencer came under attack from a hacker group called Scattered Spider (also known as Octo Tempest). They reportedly used phishing, credential theft, and deployed the ransomware DragonForce to encrypt key systems. The attack led the retailer to shut down its in-store pickup purchases and M&S' contactless payment system. The attack was part of a series of sophisticated attacks on UK retailers earlier this year, which also impacted luxury department store Harrods and supermarket chain Co-op. Later that month, M&S, in its annual report, said it estimated a £300 million hit to profits this year. Marks & Spencer chief executive Stuart Machin said hackers gained access to the retailer’s systems through one of its contractors by using \"social engineering\" techniques — methods that often involve impersonating employees to deceive helpdesk staff. He emphasised that the breach did not stem from any weakness in M&S’ own IT systems but occurred via a third-party vendor. Machin added that the company expects to recover swiftly from the disruption, with its website likely to reopen within the next few weeks and full sales operations resuming across all product categories before July. At the time, local media reports speculated that this compromised third-party contractor was Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which manages M&S’s helpdesk among other IT services. Though TCS denied any mishap from their part, the company said the breach occurred “in the client’s own environment” and that it had found “no indicators of compromise within the TCS network.” It’s worth noting that Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been Marks & Spencer’s (M&S) principal technology partner since 2018, when the UK retailer began its five-year digital transformation programme. The partnership was extended in 2023. At the time, it was noted that the extended deal would focus on modernising M&S’s core business systems, including cloud adoption, supply chain efficiency, and omnichannel capabilities. While neither company has disclosed the contract’s exact value, media reports have estimated it at around $1 billion. The above-mentioned contract, both parties have publicly confirmed, continues. According to TCS, the contract M&S has taken f",

On October 26, UK newspaper The Telegraph reported that M&S “ditched” its service desk contract with TCS because the Indian IT outsourcing giant was accused of being at fault for the devastating cyber-attack that hit the retailer in April. In a regulatory filing sent to several Indian stock exchanges on the same day, TCS described the article as “misleading” and pointed to “factual inaccuracies.” Read more: M&S and Co-op Hacks Classified as Single Cyber Event TCS said that while M&S did consider signing a service desk contract with TCS through a request for proposal (RFP) process initiated in January 2025, the retailer selected other suppliers. This choice that was made “much prior to the cyber incident in April 2025,” the TCS filing noted. “These matters are hence clearly unrelated,” The Tata Group subsidiary added. A source familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that TCS provided service desk services to M&S before January 2025, but that the UK retailer decided to select another provider following the RFP process. TCS highlighted that it has many other forms of collaboration and contracts with M&S beyond service desk and that many of these are still ongoing. Regarding the cyber-attack that took much of M&S’ digital services offline, TCS claimed that the vulnerabilities that led to the incident did not come from any of its networks and systems. This conclusion followed an investigation carried out by TCS in June. Tata noted that TCS does not provide cybersecurity services to M&S.

In a statement released on Sunday, October 27, to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), TCS termed the report “misleading” and “factually inaccurate,” clarifying that the contract value was overstated and that Marks & Spencer’s vendor decision was unrelated to any cyber incident. The clarification was issued under Regulation 30(11) of SEBI’s Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations, 2015. The company also pointed out that the service desk work formed only a small part of its overall relationship with M&S. “TCS continues to work on numerous other areas in its role as a strategic partner for Marks & Spencer and is proud of this longstanding partnership,” it said. Addressing the cyberattack claim, TCS said it had carried out a full internal scan and confirmed that no vulnerabilities originated from its network. The company emphasised that it does not provide cybersecurity services to M&S - that responsibility lies with another vendor. TCS added that both it and M&S had clarified that the renewal decision was part of a regular business process and unrelated to any cyber incident. The Telegraph article, titled “M&S ousts Indian outsourcer accused of £300m cyberattack failures”, claimed that the British retailer suffered losses worth about £300 million and subsequently ended a $1 billion deal with TCS. However, TCS called the report “highly exaggerated and baseless”, saying the contract’s value was misrepresented. The Telegraph later removed the $1 billion figure from its report after both companies clarified the details.",
